- summary: describe the tech stack used to build rege.help
    - elixir, phoenix, liveview, tailwind
    - grex, rustler
    - live dashboard
- writing for: web devs unfamiliar with the Elixir ecosystem
- lessons:
    - PETL stack is cool, still happy after the 2nd toy project
    - some things are still immature (rustler needs unrelease version)
    - however, Elixir itself is stable
