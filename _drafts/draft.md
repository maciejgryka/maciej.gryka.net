# The world of sub-50 companies

How would the world look like if no company could ever be bigger than 50 people?

Let's get the obvious out of the way first: there would be many more companies around. If 50 was the max there would most likely also be many smaller companies, from 1-person "companies" all the way through to 50.

There would have to be more competition, right? No 50-person company would be able to control any given niche, so there would have to be many entities providing sam esegices.

It's unclear how acquisitions would look like - given two 50-person companies, one could potentially buy all the assets of the other, but then all the people of the other company woud lose their jobs.

There would probably be no monopolies - while they're possible in theory, I don't think it's practical to maintain a monopoly with such a constrained workforce
