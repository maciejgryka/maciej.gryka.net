  <p>If you aspire to become an LLM Sommelier, you should definitely read this paper and use the dataset to help you. As new multimodal models are released, evaluating them and understand their relative strengths and weaknesses is hard. <a href="https://chat.lmsys.org/">LMSys</a> helps, but only gives us overall ranking, not granular understanding.</p>

  <p>This paper contributes a dataset that makes this evaluation process easier + a method for the evaluation (I love the dataset part, Iâ€™m a little skeptical about the evaluation part)</p>
