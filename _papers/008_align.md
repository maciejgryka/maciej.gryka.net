  <p>This paper is super similar to <a href="/papers-in-public/#clip">CLIP</a>, which we discussed yesterday. It came out of Google, instead of OpenAI in June 2021, so 4 months later. The idea is basically the same, with the major difference being a larger and more noisy dataset.</p>

  <p>They also use different models for embedding text and images, but overall it's the same broad approach.</p>
