There's a long history of people believing they are better humans when they are rational.

It's a dangerous path to go down, however, because in practice it often leaves important data out of the equation. Most obviously, human emotions are often discarded as if they don't exist.

If you have a choice to make and you're weighing pros and cons of each of your options, you might try to write them all down. Each item you write down is a judgement: is this particular thing important enough to include in your analysis? You might consider things like money, opportunity cost, difficulty etc. Being rational, at least in the naive understanding I'm setting up as the straw man, means mostly not writing down things like "how will this choice make me feel" or "what will others think".

If you want to make a good decision, you need to take all the information available to you into account. Purposefully ignoring your feelings and built-in irrationality is itself irrational - your feelings are likely to persist whether you acknowledge them or not and they will affect you.

In the same way, you ignore others' feelings at your peril. Not accounting for how you make others feel and just doing whatever you thing is "rational" blinds you to important information.

Think about emotions to be rational.
