Over the past months’ evenings and weekends I’ve been having fun building side projects. I’ve been fascinated by the Elixir ecosystem and wanted to learn more about it.

As is common during the pandemic I really wanted to play some board games with friends online. As is common among parents, I almost never have reliable, uninterrupted time to hang out with friends, even online.

What’s the next best thing if I can’t play a game with friends? Making one by myself! Memories of late night board game sessions at our company offsites with Rainforest came flashing back and I decided to build a simple version of Codenames.

Turns out Elixir with LiveView is a pretty great fit for something like this. The game is now online at https://words.gryka.net
