![Maciej](/static/maciej.jpeg){: .about-image}

I currently work at [RainforestQA](https://www.rainforestqa.com) doing all kinds of data-related things: machine learning, visualization, business intelligence, statistics, good ol' software development, team leading and also product management. Since joining, I designed and implemented ML-based fraud detection systems, no-code test automation product, image matching models and generative-AI based test case generation.

I got into data science was doing a [doctorate in computer vision and graphics](http://engdveiv.ucl.ac.uk/) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).

Besides building things, I also really enjoy speaking at events. You can see my [talk about automatically finding lazy workers](/talks/#gotta-catch-them-all) form PyData Amsterdam 2016, and a summary of my PhD thesis about [removing soft shadows from PyData Berlin 2016](/talks/#removing-soft-shadows) (did I mention I like PyData?).
