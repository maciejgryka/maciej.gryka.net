![Maciej](/static/maciej.jpeg){: .about-image}

I currently work at [RainforestQA](https://www.rainforestqa.com) doing all kinds of data-related things: machine learning, visualization, business intelligence, statistics, good ol' software development, team leading and also product management. I designed and implemented ML-based fraud detection systems, led the implementation of [the best-in-the-world no-code test automation](https://www.rainforestqa.com/features/test-automation) product (I might be biased), novel image matching models and [generative-AI based test case generation](https://www.rainforestqa.com/blog/preview-generative-ai-features).

I spent a year as a co-founder & CTO of [Teacherspace](https://www.linkedin.com/company/teacherspace/), where I built the web app as well as the iOS and Android mobiles apps from scratch. Ask me about how fun it is to correctly implement sensitive video storage relying solely on European cloud providers. Also, I'm a huge Elixir fanboi.

I got into data science was doing a [doctorate in computer vision and graphics](http://engdveiv.ucl.ac.uk/) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).

Besides building things, I also really enjoy speaking at events. You can see my [talk about automatically finding lazy workers](/talks/#gotta-catch-them-all) form PyData Amsterdam 2016, and a summary of my PhD thesis about [removing soft shadows from PyData Berlin 2016](/talks/#removing-soft-shadows) (did I mention I like PyData?).
