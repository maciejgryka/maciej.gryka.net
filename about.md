Hi! You apparently want to know more about me, which I'll take as a compliment. Do you also find it weird, writing about yourself? Do you learn to enjoy it, or does it always feel kind of strange?

I work at [RainforestQA](https://www.rainforestqa.com) doing all kinds of data-related things: machine learning, visualization, business intelligence, statistics. Also a bit of good ol' software development. The way I got into data science was doing a [doctorate in computer vision and graphics](http://engdveiv.ucl.ac.uk/) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). I can recommend it if you want to do research - computer vision is an amazingly fun field full of smart people. And my former supervisor, [Dr Gabriel Brostow](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/g.brostow/) is a great person to work with.

Besides building things, I also really enjoy speaking at events. I'm just getting started with this part of my life, but so far it's been great fun. For now you can see my [talk about automatically finding lazy workers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_h8PElXio8) form PyData Amsterdam 2016, but there are a few more coming this year. Feel free to poke me after July if fail at updating this!
