![Maciej](/static/maciej.jpeg){: .about-image}

My name is Maciej and I work at [RainforestQA](https://www.rainforestqa.com) doing all kinds of data-related things: machine learning, visualization, business intelligence, statistics, good ol' software development and these days mostly management. The way I got into data science was doing a [doctorate in computer vision and graphics](http://engdveiv.ucl.ac.uk/) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). I can recommend it if you want to do research - computer vision is an amazingly fun field full of smart people. And my former supervisor, [Dr Gabriel Brostow](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/g.brostow/) is a great person to work with.

Besides building things, I also really enjoy speaking at events. You can see my [talk about automatically finding lazy workers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_h8PElXio8) form PyData Amsterdam 2016, and a summary of my PhD thesis about [removing soft shadows from PyData Berlin 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlI_U_3BdqY) (did I mention I like PyData?).
